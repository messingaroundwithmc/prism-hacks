# prism-hacks
my own upstream prism meta repo for cheat clients
- org.\*/com.\*/net.\*/etc. folders are containing original meta server's files (except net.minecraft, that does also contain .json files for hacked clients jars)
- jarfiles folder contains all jars for hacked clients.
- this repo is hosted on github pages
to-do:
1. more hacked clients
2. make prismhacks.reallatteru.ru domain for this repo (ig im too lazy to connect github pages to subdomain).
